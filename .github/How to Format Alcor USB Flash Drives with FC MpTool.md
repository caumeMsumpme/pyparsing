If you have a USB flash drive that has an Alcor chip controller, you may encounter some issues with its storage capacity or performance. For example, your USB flash drive may show a larger capacity than it actually has, or it may not work properly on your computer. This is because some vendors may use fake or low-quality Alcor chips to imitate popular brands and sell them at a lower price.

Fortunately, there is a way to fix these problems by formatting your Alcor USB flash drive with a tool called FC MpTool. FC MpTool is a free software that can detect and format your Alcor chip controller so that it can display the real information and function normally. In this article, we will show you how to download and use FC MpTool to format your Alcor USB flash drive.
 
## Step 1: Download FC MpTool
 
The first step is to download FC MpTool from a reliable source. You can use the following link to download the latest version of FC MpTool (v04.01.00) as a ZIP file: [https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/FC-MpTool.shtml](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/FC-MpTool.shtml) [^1^]. This version of FC MpTool supports various Alcor chip models, such as FC8308, FC8508, FC8406, FC8708, AU698x, AU6981, AU6984, and AU6986.
 
After downloading the ZIP file, you need to extract it to a folder on your computer. You can use any file extraction software, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip, to do this. You will see a folder named "FC\_MpTool\_FC8308\_FC8508\_FC8406\_v04.01.00" that contains several files, including "FC\_MpTool.exe", which is the main executable file of FC MpTool.
 
## Step 2: Run FC MpTool
 
The next step is to run FC MpTool on your computer. You don't need to install it, as it is a portable application that can run directly from the folder. However, it is recommended that you don't run it from an external storage device (such as another USB flash drive), as it may interfere with the formatting process.
 
To run FC MpTool, simply double-click on the "FC\_MpTool.exe" file in the folder. You will see a simple user interface that has several buttons and options. You may also see a password prompt if the tool is password-protected. You can click on the "Setup" button to set or change the password if you want.
 
## Step 3: Format your Alcor USB flash drive
 
The final step is to format your Alcor USB flash drive with FC MpTool. Before you do this, make sure that you backup any important data on your USB flash drive, as formatting will erase everything on it. Also, make sure that you plug in only one USB flash drive at a time, as FC MpTool may not be able to distinguish between multiple devices.
 
Once you have prepared your USB flash drive, plug it into your computer's USB port and wait for it to be detected by FC MpTool. You will see some information about your USB flash drive on the main window of FC MpTool, such as its model name, serial number, firmware version, capacity, and status.
 
To format your USB flash drive, click on the "Start" button at the bottom of the window. You will see a progress bar that shows the formatting process. It may take some time depending on the size and condition of your USB flash drive. When the formatting is done, you will see a message that says "Format OK".
 
You can now unplug your USB flash drive from your computer and check its properties on your file explorer. You should see that its capacity and performance have been restored to normal. You can also use your USB flash drive on any other
